As the oxygen allows our body to move, public transport is the motor of New York. Most people in New York rely on public transport or rental services to move around the city. Inside public transportation methods, taxi transportation has a big role in the transportation network of the city. Therefore, an analysis of the taxi operation can show insights about the behaviour of the city.
The initial study is centred on Taxi trends throughout the year and the day. Additionally, it will also be used information obtained to make a comparison with new transport providers like Uber and to visually see the impact of the recent Covid-Pandemic on life in big cities. 
We believe this data-set provides endless opportunities and that we have only scratched the surface with our studies. However, some our visualisations can be observed or interacted to show how fascinating the data-set is. 
Our Analysis is guided by a Consistent Visual Platform which we use to direct the path of interest of the User, providing multiple articles as well as summaries and annotations.
